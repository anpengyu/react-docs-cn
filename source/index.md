description: Apollo Client manages server-side GraphQL data in your React app so you don't have to.
---

This is the official guide for using GraphQL in your React or React Native app using the [react-apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) package. React-Apollo is a convenient yet powerful way to bind GraphQL queries to your React components, so that you can focus on developing your UI while data fetching and management get out of the way. At the same time, it has all of the hooks and extension points for you to be fully in control.

Follow the repositories on GitHub: [React-Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo), [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), and [this docs site](https://github.com/apollographql/react-docs).

<h2 id="tutorials">Getting started</h2>

If you're familiar with web development, but haven't tried GraphQL or Apollo before, we've got you covered. Here's a set of small tutorials and examples you can look at, and in just a few hours you'll be well on your way to being an expert GraphQL developer! Or, you can jump right in to [installing the library](initialization.html).

<h3 id="simple-example">[1. Simple example](simple-example.html)</h3>

Dive into a basic app that displays one view with React Native and Apollo. It's the app you saw on the home page of Apollo Client, but with some suggestions of how to interact with it, and the code explained in more detail.

<h3 id="full-stack-graphql" title="2. Full-Stack Tutorial">[2. Full-Stack GraphQL + React Tutorial](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/full-stack-react-graphql-tutorial-582ac8d24e3b#.cwvxzphyc)</h3>

This tutorial covers how to set up Apollo Client, how to write a simple server, and how to connect them together, and more parts are being produced almost every week. It's written by [Jonas Helfer](https://twitter.com/helferjs), the main developer behind React-Apollo.

<h3 id="learn-apollo">[3. Learn Apollo](https://www.learnapollo.com)</h3>

This community-developed tutorial covers building the client side of a simple Pokedex app from start to finish. It's available for [React](https://www.learnapollo.com/tutorial-react/react-01), [React Native](https://www.learnapollo.com/tutorial-react-native/react-native-01), and other platforms. Learn Apollo is maintained by the team and community around [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), a hosted GraphQL backend platform that lets you stand up a GraphQL server without writing any code.

<h3 id="usage-recipes">[4. Usage and recipes](queries.html)</h3>

Once you've done the interactive examples and tutorials, you're ready to dive in deeper. We've tried to write this guide so that you can read it like a book and discover everything you can do with Apollo and GraphQL. In particular, check out the "Usage" section for basic functionality like queries and mutations, and the "Recipes" section for specific directions about how to accomplish more advanced goals like server-side rendering. If you run into anything, don't hesitate to ask a question on [Stack Overflow with the `apollo` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apollo), or on the [Apollo community Slack](http://dev.apollodata.com/#slack)!

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatible tools</h2>

The primary design point of Apollo Client is to work with the client or server tools you're already using. The maintainers and contributors focus on solving the hard problems around GraphQL caching, request management, and UI updating, and we want that to be available to anyone regardless of their technical requirements and preferences for other parts of the app.

<h3 id="react-toolbox">The React toolbox</h3>

Apollo is specifically designed to work nicely with all of the tools used by today's React developers. Here are some in particular:

- **React Native and Expo**: Apollo works out of the box in React Native. It's even preinstalled in [Expo Sketch](https://sketch.expo.io/H1QdWZUjg), so you can build a React Native + Apollo app right in your browser.
- **Redux**: Apollo Client uses Redux internally, and you can [integrate it into your existing store](redux.html) to use your favorite Redux tools such as the dev tools or persistence libraries. You can also use Apollo alongside any other data management library, such as MobX.
- **React Router**: Apollo Client is completely router-independent, which means you can use it with any version of [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) or any other routing library for React. It's even easy to set up [server-side rendering](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/server-side-rendering.html).
- **Recompose**: With [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose), React-Apollo's Higher Order Component can be combined with a variety of other utilities to add behaviors to your components. [Read how to use it for loading state and variables](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/simplify-your-react-components-with-apollo-and-recompose-8b9e302dea51#.z7tbkf8er) and also [mutations](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/how-i-write-mutations-in-apollo-w-recompose-1c0ab06ef4ea#.iobufopba) and to [combine with the Redux container](https://medium.com/welikegraphql/use-of-recompose-in-universal-react-apollo-example-3d1f89bc945b#.dtxnibu0w).
- **Next.js**: You can use Apollo with the lightweight Next.js framework for universal rendered React apps. Just check out [this article](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/whats-next-js-for-apollo-e4dfe835d070) for the details, or download the [official example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-apollo).

If you have a favorite React tool, and something in Apollo makes it difficult to integrate, open an issue and let's work together to make it work nicely and add it to the list!

<h3 id="graphql-servers">GraphQL servers</h3>

Because it doesn't assume anything beyond the official GraphQL specification, Apollo works with every GraphQL server implementation, for every language. It doesn't impose any requirements on your schema either; if you can send a query to a standard GraphQL server, Apollo can handle it. You can find a list of GraphQL server implementations on [graphql.org](http://graphql.org/code/#server-libraries).

<h3 id="other-platforms">Other JS + native platforms</h3>

This documentation site is specifically about React, but Apollo has an implementation for every client platform:

- JavaScript
  - [Angular](/angular)
  - [Vanilla JS](/core)
- Native mobile
  - [Native iOS with Swift](http://dev.apollodata.com/ios/)
  - [Native Android with Java](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android)

<h2 id="goals">Project goals</h2>

Apollo Client is a JavaScript client for GraphQL. We built Apollo Client to be:

1. **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.
2. **Universally compatible**, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.
2. **Simple to get started with**, you can just read a small tutorial and get going.
3. **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.
4. **Built for interactive apps**, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.
5. **Community driven**, so that you can be confident that the project will grow with your needs. Apollo packages are co-developed with production users from the start, and all projects are planned and developed in the open on GitHub so that there aren't any surprises.

Apollo Client does more than simply run your queries against your GraphQL server. It analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations are run. This means that your UI can be internally consistent and fully up-to-date with the state on the server with the minimum number of queries required.

<h2 id="comparison">Other GraphQL clients</h2>

If you are deciding whether to use `react-apollo` or some other GraphQL client, it's worth considering the [goals](#goals) of the project, and how they compare. Here are some additional points:

 - [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) is a performance-oriented and highly opinionated GraphQL client built by Facebook for their mobile applications. It focuses on enabling the co-location of queries and components, and is opinionated about the design of your GraphQL schema, especially in the case of pagination. Apollo has an analogous set of features to Relay, but is designed to be a general-purpose tool that can be used with any schema or any frontend architecture. Relay's coupling to a specific architecture enables some benefits but with the loss of some flexibility, which also lets the Apollo community iterate more rapidly and quickly test experimental features.
 - [Lokka](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka) is a simple GraphQL Javascript client with a basic query cache. Apollo is more complex, but includes a much more sophisticated cache and set of advanced features around updating and refetching data.
